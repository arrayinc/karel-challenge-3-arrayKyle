Write a program that teaches Karel to climb a mountain.

The steps involved are to:

1. Move up to the mountain.
2. Climb each of the four stair steps to reach the summit.
3. Plant a flag (represented by a beeper, of course) at the top of the mountain.
4. Climb down each of the four stair steps on the opposite side.
5. Move forward to the east end of the world.
